For deploying Tailwind projects on github pages, we can directly use
Tailwind play cdn from tailwind official website without any installation.

just add  =>
 <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> 
 inside the <head> in index.html, this will allow us to run every non-custom tailwind css property
//for reference, check tailwind/Razorpay-clone project

Also for applying custom tailwind styles, we have to define it inside the <head> in index.html

like =>

<script>
      tailwind.config={
        theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        mullish: ["Mulish", "sans-serif"],
      },
      colors: {
        deepBlue: "#02042a",
        lightBlue: "#2b84ea",
        lightBlue300: "#4b94ed",
        lightBlue500: "#0b72e7",
        greenLight: "#61cea6",
        grayText: "#818597",
        lightGray: "#e2e2e2",
        grayBlue: "#344a6c",
        deepBlueHead: "#162f56",
        gray2: "#525a76",
      },},
  }
      }
    </script>

    which can/may be present in the tailwind.config.js file
    This information is also available in tailwind official website

For deploying in netlify/vercel
first, you need to add "build": "build vite" inside scripts inside the package.json file
like =>

 "scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
  }

  After that, run the following command in the terminal =>
  npm run build 

  This will make our code deployable or production level
  Also this will make a new directory "dist" inside our main directory
  We have to upload this new directory "dist" in netlify/vercel for deploying our code
  Not sure but I think npm run build makes new css file which contains every css property
  we have used in our code. Every file other than index.html is present inside assets folder inside dist folder
